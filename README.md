# The openEHR Assistant MCP Server (PHP)

A PHP 8.4 [Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) to assist end-user on various openEHR related tasks and APIs.

- Works with MCP clients such as Claude Desktop, Cursor, LibreChat or other clients that support MCP
- Exposes tools for openEHR Archetypes and specifications
- Optional guided Prompts help orchestrate multi-step workflows

## Features

- PHP 8.4; PSR-compliant codebase
- Attribute-based MCP tool discovery (via https://github.com/mcp/sdk)
- Docker images for production and development
- Transports: streamable HTTP and stdio (for development)
- Structured logging with Monolog
- Simple, environment-driven configuration

## Available MCP Elements

### Tools

CKM (Clinical Knowledge Manager)
- `ckm_archetype_search` - List archetypes from the CKM server
- `ckm_archetype_get` - Get a CKM archetype by its CID identifier

openEHR Type specification
- `type_specification_search` - List bundled openEHR Type specifications using `namePattern` (supports `*` wildcard) and an optional keyword (filters by type specification content). Returns `type`, `description`, `component`, and `file` (relative path).
- `type_specification_get` - Retrieve an openEHR Type specification (as BMM JSON) by relative file path or by openEHR type name. Note: these are BMM type definitions, not JSON Schema

### Prompts

Optional prompts that guide AI assistants through common openEHR and CKM workflows using the tools above.
- `ckm_archetype_explorer` - Explore CKM archetypes by listing and fetching definitions (ADL/XML/Mindmap) by CID.
- `type_specification_explorer` - Discover and fetch openEHR Type specifications (as BMM JSON) using type_specification_search and type_specification_get.

## Transports

- `stdio`: Suitable for process-based MCP clients
- `streamable-http` (default): HTTPS (port 443) or HTTP server on port `8343` on the dev container.

Start option: pass `--transport=stdio` or `--transport=streamable-http` to `public/index.php`; if `--transport` is skipped, the default is `streamable-http`.

## Quick Start with Docker

Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

>Note: Container images are published to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) as `ghcr.io/cadasto/openehr-assistant-mcp:latest` (you can use this image name anywhere you would use the Docker image reference).

1) Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cadasto/openehr-assistant-mcp.git
cd openehr-assistant-mcp
```

2) Run the MCP server (production image)

```bash
# optionally create .env file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env as needed (see variables below)
docker compose up -d mcp --build
```

The server listens by default at https://openehr-assistant-mcp.local (on port `443`) using the streamable HTTP transport, served by Caddy inside the container.
You can change the domain suffix by setting the `DOMAIN` variable (defaults to `local`).

## Development

Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose

1) Start dev container

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d mcp --build --force-recreate
```

2) Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env as needed (see variables below)
```

3) Install dependencies (composer vendor directory is volume mounted)

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec mcp composer install
```

4) Use the MCP server
Use the streamable HTTP transport with http://openehr-assistant-mcp.local:8343/ address in your MCP client.
> Note: The dev container is configured to expose port 8343 on the host.
> The codebase is volume-mounted inside the container. 

Alternatively, run the MCP server as stdio:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec mcp php public/index.php --transport=stdio
```
or, in case the MCP client does not have direct access to the docker compose project, but the image is already built (use `make build` to build the image):
```bash
docker run --rm -i cadasto/openehr-assistant-mcp:latest php public/index.php --transport=stdio
```

or alternatively, in case the MCP client does not have direct access to the docker compose project, but the image is already built (use `make build` to build the image):
```bash
docker run --rm -i cadasto/openehr-assistant-mcp:latest php public/index.php --transport=stdio
```

Makefile shortcuts:
- Start services: `make up` (prod) or `make up-dev` (dev override with live mounts)
- Build images: `make build` (prod) or `make build-dev` (dev)
- Prepare `.env`: `make env`
- Install deps in dev container: `make install`
- Tail logs: `make logs`
- Open a shell in the dev container: `make sh`
- Run MCP inspector: `make inspector
- Make help: `make help`

## Environment Variables

- `APP_ENV`: application environment (`development`/`production`). Default: `development`
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Monolog level (`debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, etc.). Default: `info`
- `CKM_API_BASE_URL`: base URL for the openEHR CKM REST API. Default: `https://ckm.openehr.org/ckm/rest`
- `HTTP_TIMEOUT`: HTTP client timeout in seconds (float). Default: `2.0`
- `HTTP_SSL_VERIFY`: set to `false` to disable verification or provide a CA bundle path. Default: `true`

Note: Authorization headers are not required nor configured by default. If you need to add auth to your upstream openEHR/CKM server, extend the HTTP client in `src/Apis` to add the appropriate headers.

## Integrations (Claude Desktop and LibreChat)

### Claude Desktop mcpServers example

Example for local development (use Docker)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openehr-assistant-mcp": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "-i", "--rm", 
        "cadasto/openehr-assistant-mcp:latest",
        "php", "public/index.php", "--transport=stdio"
      ]
    }, 
    "openehr-assistant-mcp-8343": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "http://host.docker.internal:8343/",
      "note": "Dev running container port 8343"
    }
  }
}
```

### Streamable HTTP in LibreChat

LibreChat.ai MCP example
- Run first the MCP server (see above, e.g. `docker compose up -d mcp` or `make up`)
- The dev server is accessible at http://localhost:8343/
- Run the LibreChat server (see https://github.com/LibreChat/librechat-server)
- Configure LibreChat to use the MCP server (see https://github.com/LibreChat/librechat-server/blob/main/docs/mcp.md)
- The server is compatible with LibreChat’s MCP integration. Example minimal server entry in LibreChat config (YAML):
```yaml
mcpServers:
    openehr-assistant-mcp:
        type: streamable-http
        url: http://host.docker.internal:8343/
```

## Testing and QA

- Unit tests: `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec mcp composer test` (PHPUnit 12)
- Test with coverage: `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec mcp composer test:coverage`
- Static analysis: `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec mcp composer check:phpstan`

Tips
- You can also `make sh` and run `composer test` inside the container interactively.
